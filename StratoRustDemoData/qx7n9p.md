# Attention Mechanisms in Vision-Language Models

Recent advances in multimodal AI systems have shown remarkable progress in understanding both visual and textual information. This research investigates the role of cross-attention layers in VLM architectures, particularly focusing on how transformer-based models process image-text pairs.

Key findings:
- LLM backbones with 175B parameters show emergent multimodal capabilities
- Vision transformers (ViT) integrated with language models outperform traditional CNNs
- Contrastive learning objectives improve alignment between modalities

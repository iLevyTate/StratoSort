Large Language Model Scaling Laws and Emergent Abilities
=========================================================

This paper presents empirical research on scaling behaviors observed in transformer-based language models ranging from 1B to 540B parameters. We analyze the relationship between model size, training compute, and downstream task performance across various NLP benchmarks.

Our experiments with GPT-style architectures reveal critical phase transitions in reasoning capabilities. The study includes comprehensive ablation studies on attention heads, layer normalization, and positional encoding schemes in modern LLMs.
